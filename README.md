## What is Utingen

Traditionally, Applicant Tracking Systems used by recriuitment comapnies and departments were an adaptation of what is known as a CRM but with labels that would resemble identificable portions of the recruitment process.

Overtime, the complexity of the recruitment proces has grown influenced by the high demand (particularly in the IT market) and the specialization level and branching of the talent base opening a path for the development of talent management techniques an procedures that the real recruiting experts apply nowadays.

Utingen is a talent management foundation that packages lots of such techniques seamlessly rolled over a 15+ years aged recruitment process, nicely served in the form of a service that uses best-of-breed technologies.

As a result we get a very robust packaged-in-code process that is fun and easy to develop, simple but powerful and capable of growing like a katamari.
